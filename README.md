## Key Questions

1. **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
2. **Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?**
3. **How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**

## Project Summary

- I am a junior data analyst at **Cyclistic**, working for the **marketing analytics team**.
- The **director of marketing** believes that future success is dependent on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
- Our team has been tasked with understanding the differences between how **casual members** and **annual members** use Cyclistic bikes.
- Using these insights, we are to engineer a new **marketing strategy** to convert casual riders into annual members.
- These recommendations must be backed up by **data** and **visualizations** to make a compelling case for the executives to approve the recommendations.

## Business Task

**Cyclistic** is a bike-share company in **Chicago**. The executive director believes that annual memberships will help drive future growth. At present, **casual riders** (who use single-ride or full-day passes) make up a large portion of Cyclistic's customer base. However, **annual memberships** are more profitable.

The **marketing team**, led by **Lily Moreno**, wants to implement a campaign to convert casual riders into annual members. To achieve this, our task as the **data analytics team** for the project is to:

1. Analyze the difference between how **annual members** and **casual riders** use Cyclistic bikes.
2. Identify the key reasons that might attract casual riders to purchase an **annual membership**.
3. Explore ways in which **social media** can influence casual riders to become members.

Moreno has assigned me with answering the first question: *How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*

To achieve this objective, we will be using **historical bike trip data** to provide meaningful insights into these areas and engineer data-driven recommendations for the marketing team. These insights will be used to put the case forward to the executive team for approval of the new marketing strategies.

I am to produce a report with the following deliverables:

1. A clear statement of the **business task**.
2. A description of all **data sources** used.
3. Documentation of any **cleaning or manipulation of data**.
4. A summary of your **analysis**.
5. Supporting **visualizations** and **key findings**.
6. Your **top three recommendations** based on your analysis.

The following case study roadmap can be used as a guide:
